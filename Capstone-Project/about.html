    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="photo/Photo3.JPG" alt="Caitlyn">
    
    <p>My name is Caitlyn Dickman, and I am a senior at Craig High School. I am a member of National Art Honors Society, Chamber Choir, and social media manager for Tri-Music Honors Society. As well as that I am president of Choir Leadership and have been in Acapella Choir for three years and in the choir department my entire high school career. I am a percussionist for Wind Ensemble, and have taken part in community and high school theatre, as well as Spotlighters Show Choir. </p>
    <p>I was a part of Cross Country for two seasons my sophomore to junior year, and Track and Field for long distance my sophomore year. I varsity lettered in both, as well as academics. </p>
    <p>I previously worked at Texas Roadhouse my junior year as a host and to-go trainer. Before that I was a sales associate for my local Five Below. As of right now I am focusing on my studies, and will find a new job in the summer.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>My career goals are to possibly run a theatre or a business, and teach on the side. I have been accepted into Carthage's music department for musical theatre, and still have to audition at Whitewater (as those are my top two choices as of right now). </p>
